# Mathematical Logic

Course was designed and taught by [Dmitry Shtukenberg](https://github.com/shd) at ITMO University in 2019 (year2017, 4th semester).

## Labs

1. Expression parsing
2. Proof minimization
3. Glivenko's theorem
4. Completeness of predicate calculus
5. Proof checking in formal arithmetic
6. Representability in formal arithmetic

All [solutions (ru)](lab/tasks.pdf) are stored in one file, [solutions](lab) of all tasks are represented in Java.

## Homeworks

List of all homeworks [is available on course page (ru)](https://github.com/shd/logic2019/blob/master/hw-theory.pdf).
